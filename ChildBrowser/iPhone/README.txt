The child browser allows you to display external webpages within your PhoneGap application.

A simple use case would be:

- Users can post links, and you don't want your users to exit your app to view the link.

This command creates a popup browser that is shown in front of your app, when the user presses the done button they are simply returned to your app ( actually they never left )

The ChildBrowser has buttons for refreshing, navigating back + forwards, as well as the option to open in Safari.

Note, because this is open source, I could not include the graphics I usually use for the back/forward and safari buttons.  I have changed the XIB file to use system buttons ( rewind / fast-forward + action ) Ideally you should modify the XIB to use your own look.

Here is a sample command to open google in a childbrowser :

PhoneGap.exec("ChildBrowserCommand.showWebPage", "http://www.google.com");
